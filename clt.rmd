# Central Limit Theorem

## Introduction

The Central Limit Theorem (CLT) decribes the characteristics of the
**population of the means** which has been created from the means of
an infinte number of random population sample of size (n), all of them
drawn from a given **parent population**.

## Properties of CLT

1. Mean of sampling distribution
2. SD of the sampling distribution
3. Distribution of the sampling distribution

## SD of the sampling distribution

\[ s = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} \]

## Demonstration: rolling a six-sided dice

## Rolling one dice for 100000 times

```{r fig.width=7, fig.height=6}
onedice <- sample(c(1,2,3,4,5,6), 100000, replace=TRUE)
hist(onedice, main="Rolling one dice for 100000 times", xlab="Score", ylab="Freq")
```

The mean and SD are `r mean(onedice)` and `r sd(onedice)` respectively.

## Rolling five dices for 100000 times

```{r fig.width=7, fig.height=6}
fivedices <- replicate(100000, mean(sample(c(1,2,3,4,5,6), 5, replace=TRUE)))
hist(fivedices, main="Sample Mean score of 5 dices, repeat for 100000 times", xlab="Sample mean", ylab="Freq", xlim=c(0,7))
```

The mean and SD are `r mean(fivedices)` and `r sd(fivedices)` respectively.

## Rolling 100 dices for 100000 times

```{r fig.width=7, fig.height=6}
hundreddices <- replicate(100000, mean(sample(c(1,2,3,4,5,6), 100, replace=TRUE)))
hist(hundreddices, main="Sample Mean score of 100 dices, repeat for 100000 times", xlab="Sample mean", ylab="Freq", xlim=c(0,7))
```

The mean and SD are `r mean(hundreddices)` and `r sd(hundreddices)` respectively.

## Table

```{r results='asis', echo=FALSE}
library(plyr)
summary.table <- ldply(data.frame(onedice, fivedices,hundreddices),function(x) { c(mean(x), sd(x)) })
colnames(summary.table) <- c("simulation", "mean", "SD")
kable(summary.table)
```
